This section explains the recommended steps for managing Docker Compose when using the Docker service.

## 1. Start the Docker Service

Before using Docker Compose, you need to ensure that the Docker service is running. To start the Docker service, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

This command will start the Docker engine, enabling it to run containers as required by Docker Compose.

# Docker Compose Configuration

This guide provides instructions on how to configure and start Docker Compose correctly using the necessary commands.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your system.
- Ensure that the Docker service is running (see the **MscRcmnd** section).

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Start the Docker Service

To start Docker on the system, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker.service
```

### 2. Stop and Rebuild Containers with Docker Compose

Once Docker is running, you can stop any existing containers and rebuild them using Docker Compose. Run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down && sudo docker compose up --build
```

- **docker-compose down**: Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes associated with the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **docker compose up --build**: Rebuilds and starts the containers based on the `docker-compose.yml` configuration.

Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured in your current directory before running the command.

## Verification

To check that your containers are running correctly, use:

```bash
sudo docker ps
